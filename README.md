=======

This is a ROS node used to control dynamixel servo-motors, which are manufactured by Robotis. It is based on the libdynamixel library that can be found on the [author's repository](https://github.com/jbmouret/libdynamixel).

The work on the code, as well as the documentation is ongoing (August 2015).
