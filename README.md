# dynamixel_control

## Purpose

This is a ROS node used to control dynamixel servo-motors, which are manufactured by Robotis. It is based on the [libdynamixel] library.

## Status

**We no longer develop nor use this code**. Please refer to [dynamixel_control_hw], a replacement that leverages the ros_control framework.
